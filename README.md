# Linear Regression Examples

This repository contains examples of implementing linear regression using gradient descent and the method of least squares with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) pseudoinverse. Both methods are demonstrated using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Introduction

Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics used for modeling the relationship between two variables. This repository provides two different approaches to perform linear regression:

1. **Gradient Descent**: This method involves iteratively updating the parameters of the regression model to minimize the cost function, which measures the difference between predicted and actual values.

2. **Least Squares with SVD Pseudoinverse**: This approach uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compute the pseudoinverse of the feature matrix, providing a closed-form solution for linear regression.

## Usage

The repository contains one Jupyter notebook:

1. **`Gradient Descent`**: Demonstrates linear regression using gradient descent. 

2. **`SVD Pseudoinverse`**: Shows linear regression using the method of least squares with SVD pseudoinverse.

To run the notebook, you can use Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebooks:

- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
